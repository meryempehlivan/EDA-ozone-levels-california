# EDA-ozone-levels-california
This report presents the analysis of Ozone Concentration in the California State in 2024. It mainly focuses on temporal and regional aspects, and analyzes the patterns and nuances regarding the parts of California in terms of seasons, land, and urban activity. 

This project is done in the Data Lab of Data Camp environment.
#### Project Status: Completed

## Project Introduction
This report focuses on understanding the factors affecting ozone levels and identifying high-risk areas to recommend effective regulatory interventions. The most challenging aspect of this project was data cleaning, which accounted for nearly half of the entire process.

### Objectives
1. Analyze the variation of daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration over time and across regions.
2. Identify areas that consistently show high ozone concentrations and compare results from different measurement methods.
3. Examine the effect of urban activity by comparing ozone levels between weekdays and weekends.
4. Generate a geospatial heatmap to visualize regions with elevated ozone concentrations.

### Technologies
Python

### Needs of this project
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Visualisation
5. Evaluation
6. Recommendations
7. Reporting
